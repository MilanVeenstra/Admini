# Repository Etiquette

## Branching
- `main` is stable.
- Feature branches: `feature/<short-desc>`.
- Bugfix branches: `fix/<short-desc>`.

## Commits
- Follow Conventional Commits:
  - `feat: add OCR extraction`
  - `fix: correct VAT rounding`
  - `docs: update setup guide`

## Pull Requests
- All PRs require at least one review.
- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Update docs/tests with each PR.

## Merge Policy
- Use **squash merges** for features.
- Rebase locally only for cleaning up personal commits.
